	<h3>My intrests in IT</h3>
	<p>My keenness for IT begun around the age of 6 when I first started playing 100 in 1 games on the NES at home, since then I've played many different gaming genres on many different gaming consoles for 25 years. Playing games for so long has given me the desire to make my own game(s) to the extent of me completing a game design and production course which I learned on Unreal Engine how to create maps, and map and object texturing, pseudo coding via node tethering. On Maya I learned how to create 3D digital objects with 2D reference images and how to transfer them to my game.</p><p>Other than gaming I've worked as a control tower clerk for 2 years using 3 different programs and operating a 2-way radio overseeing containers being stacked in a container yard as well as containers being loaded onto trucks, drove the same 60T machine (called a straddle) which moved the shipping containers around while operating a 2-way radio, following instructions off a single program (e.g which container to lift and where to put it), and monitoring engine/spreader (the spreader does the lifting) status.</p>
	<h3>Why I chose RMIT</h3>
	<p>I started searching for an IT course on google through which I found the<a href="http:/www.open.edu.au/" target="_blank"><strong><em> link to Open Universities Australia</em></strong></a> where I left my name and contact number upon entering the site which I closed quite quickly rather than commiting to my goal. The next morning I received a phone call from OUA inquiring about my visit to their website, and within 30 minutes I'd enrolled and paid for my IT course with RMIT in full which i found very affordable, I feel like RMIT chose me to be a student in a way.</p>
	<h3>What do I expect to learn?</h3>
	<p>I'm hoping I'll learn more about information technology than just HTML and CSS on a collaborative platform even though this course is to learn how to cover the basics. I'm hoping to gain knowledge about hardware components and how to assemble a PC properly which is something I've never done.</p>

	<h2>Personality test results</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality" target="_blank"><strong><em>16personalities test results</em></strong></a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=6&V=9&T=5" target="_blank"><strong><em>Learning style test results</em></strong></a></li>

	</ul>
</div>
<div class="container">
	<div class="box-2">
	<h3>What these results mean to me?</h3>
	<p>The 16personalities test told me what I already know about myself mediating others problems, and to buy premium content (no thank you). The learning style test I found a lot more rewarding, being a quick test and giving me multiple useful instructions to help me learn better. The career explorer results were good for whittling down potential careers that intrest me that coincide with my personality traits.</p>
	<h3>How do I think these results will affect my behaviour in a team?</h3>
	<p>The word "lazy" in a personality test is never a good thing, although I can change that by applying and commiting myself into working on a project even if my idea's aren't shared by the team. Working online with mostly text based conversations will be extremely helpful when it comes to my visual learning style, if we start using microphones to communicate I will most likely be typing questions about what was said.</p>
	<h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
	<p>I'd like to start by saying I've joined one for assessment 2 of this IT course mostly due to someone else reaching out and recruiting me. For future team building though being the shy/quiet type I find it best to just throw my ideas out there no matter what might be said, I do find it easier to work with more outspoken team members who are more diligent than myself especially if they're agreeing to work with my ideas for a project.

	<h2>A Gameplay Engineer for Ubisoft</h2>
	<p>To me this job is coding and programming for video games owned by a large successful AAA gaming company. I find this job appealing because I've played a great number of their game titles and thoroughly enjoyed them on top of always wanting to pursue a career in game development.</p>
	<p>The job itself requiring an employee with at least 3 years of experience in game engineering who has worked on published game titles, even if they're an undergraduate in Software Engineering, Computer Science, or similar area. Seeking of someone who can work well in a team with designers and artists to produce a projected vision of a game. Knowlede of C/C++ is a must just like verbal and communication skills with team members.</p>
	<p>I've previously done a game design course in which i started working on my own game using psuedo code (node tethering) on unreal engine which i only managed to implement one original asset from a 3D moddeling program called Maya.</p><p>My plans to improve my skills start here studying with RMIT and completing this close to mechanicless game which I'll need to complete a programming course for if I plan on learning C/C++ and shipping it any way shape or form. When I complete this project and at least get gameplay feedback for I will start on my next game project since the more titles I can ship will ultimately get me closer to my goal of Gameplay Engineer for Ubisoft.</p>
